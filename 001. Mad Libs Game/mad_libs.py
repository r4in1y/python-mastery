    story = f"""One sunny morning, a group of {adj1} adventurers set off on a journey into the wild, untamed Amazon jungle. They packed {plural_noun1}, {plural_noun2}, and a giant {noun1}, just in case they encountered a {adj2} problem. As they walked through the dense jungle, they suddenly heard a loud {animal_sound}. "What was that?!" yelled {name_of_person1}, looking around nervously. Out of the trees, a massive, {adj3} {animal1} appeared, covered in {plural_noun3}. "This is it!" screamed {name_of_person2}, "We're gonna get {adj4}!" But just then a {adj5} {animal2} swoooped down and stole their last bag of {food_item1}! "No! Not the {food_item2}!" cried the group. "We'll never survive the jungle without it!" They quickly followed the {adj6} creature into the jungle, which led them to a {adj7} waterfall. Beneath the water, they saw something shiny, a {adj8} treasure chest! "it's the legendary {adj9} treasure!" shouted {name_of_person3}. "Let's open it!" But as they touched the chest, the ground began to {verb}, and a giant {adj10} {animal3} burst from the earth! "RUN" yelled {name_of_person4}. The group sprinted through the jungle, dodging {plural_noun4} and {plural_noun5}, until they reached the safety of a {adj11} treehouse. Panting and out of breath, {name_of_person5} wiped their brow, "Well, at least we still have our {noun2}... and our {adj12} sense of adventure."
